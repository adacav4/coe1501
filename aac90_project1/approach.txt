Adarsh Cavale - aac90 - COE 1501 Project 1 approach

I implemented the Node class and the DLB class on top of that. Then I created a new class for DLB<Character, String> specific methods that I could use in the auto complete. I stored the word stored as the value of the terminal node and searched accordingly. I searched the user history trie first to make sure that user history got higher priority.
